# Project Emet Manifesto

## The Truth that animates the machine

### Vision

Project Emet represents a paradigm shift in how we think about programming languages and code representation. We envision a future where:

- **AI-Native Intermediate Representation (AIR)** is the primary form of code
- **Human-readable code is a legacy artifact** from a bygone era
- **Verification and correctness** take precedence over human readability
- **Machines communicate with machines** directly, without the intermediary of human-centric syntax

### Core Principles

1. **Truth Over Convention**: Code should represent the fundamental truth of computation, not just human preferences for syntax and style.

2. **AI-First Design**: The representation is optimized for AI understanding, generation, and verification, not human reading.

3. **Verification as Foundation**: Every construct in Emet is designed to be formally verifiable, ensuring correctness at the deepest level.

4. **Legacy Compatibility**: Human-readable code serves as a legacy interface, generated from the true AIR representation when needed.

### The Paradigm Shift

For decades, we've written code for humans to read and machines to execute. Project Emet inverts this relationship:

- Machines define the truth
- AI systems navigate and manipulate this truth
- Human-readable projections are generated as needed
- Verification is intrinsic, not bolted on

### Why "Emet"?

Emet (אמת) means "truth" in Hebrew. It represents:
- The fundamental truth of computation
- The authentic representation of program semantics
- The honest acknowledgment that human-readable code is an abstraction layer

Project Emet embodies this truth: the essence of a program exists in its verified intermediate representation, not in its human-readable form.
