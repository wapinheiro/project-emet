# Project Emet

> **The Truth that animates the machine.**

## An AI-Native Intermediate Representation

Project Emet is a revolutionary approach to programming language design where **human-readable code is a legacy artifact**. Instead of treating source code as the primary representation, Emet establishes an AI-Native Intermediate Representation (AIR) as the source of truth.

### Core Philosophy

- **AIR as Foundation**: The AI-Native Intermediate Representation is the primary form of code
- **Human Code as Projection**: Traditional source code is generated from AIR when needed
- **Verification First**: Formal correctness is intrinsic, not an afterthought
- **Machine Intelligence**: Optimized for AI reasoning, manipulation, and verification

### What Makes Emet Different

Traditional programming flows from human-readable source to machine code. Emet inverts this:

```
Traditional: Human Code → IR → Machine Code
Emet:        AIR ⇄ AI Systems → (Projections | Machine Code)
```

In the Emet paradigm:
- Computational truth lives in the AIR
- AI systems directly manipulate and verify this truth
- Human-readable views are generated on-demand
- Verification is built-in, not bolted-on

## Documentation

- **[Manifesto](docs/MANIFESTO.md)**: Vision and principles behind Project Emet
- **[Core Concepts](docs/CONCEPTS.md)**: Technical concepts and architecture
- **[RFCs](rfcs/)**: Technical proposals and specifications

## Why "Emet"?

Emet (אמת) means "truth" in Hebrew. This name reflects:
- The fundamental truth of computation
- The authentic representation of program semantics  
- The honest acknowledgment that human-readable code is an abstraction

Project Emet is about revealing and working with the truth that animates the machine.

## Status

Project Emet is in early conceptual development. We are defining the core AIR specification and exploring the implications of this paradigm shift.
